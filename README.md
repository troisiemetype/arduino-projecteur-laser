Laser projector
===============

This program is intended to provide some visual informations for a laser projector, set the laser output intensity, and light and cut it at beginning and end of exposure.

The output intensity is set by an incremental coder. It's generated by using PWM output of timers of the Atmel processor.

Visual feedback is given by a small oled screen.

Laser is turn on and off by continuously reading the audio stream, and comapring each value to the previous one. If values change, laser is on, else it's shut.
