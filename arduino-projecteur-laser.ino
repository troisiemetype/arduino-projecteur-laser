// Arduino laser projector

/* This program is intended to control a laser projector
 * The projector is controled by positions sent by a programm sent via UART link
 */
 /*
  * This is the main program that runs the projector.
  * It does the initial setup by calling the dedicated sub-program initialize functions,
  * then runs the main loop, calling each part one after the other.
  * 
  * The program is composed of these modules: 
  * Serial: Set and use the serial UART data flow, get data from PC.
  * Planner: populates buffer with coordinates from the data received.
  * Driver: Use an interrupt to update position on a regular basis.
  * I2C. Transmit position from the driver to DAC trough I2C.
  * Settings. Store general settings. Settings that are dedicated to a sub_program are stored in thier respectives header files.
